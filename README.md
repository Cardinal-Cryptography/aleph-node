This repository contains the Rust implementation of [Aleph Zero][aleph-homepage] blockchain node based on the [Substrate][substrate-homepage] framework.

Aleph Zero is an open-source layer 1 blockchain focused on privacy, scalability and energy efficiency. It is based on a unique, peer-reviewed consensus algorithm, AlephBFT (as described in our [paper][aleph-bft-paper] and implemented [here][aleph-bft-link]).

Aleph node is based on a Substrate node where the default finality gadget (GRANDPA) has been replaced with AlephBFT. Block authoring is realized with Substrate's Aura. The chain is run in periodic sesssions (900 blocks each) utilizing the Session pallet. The authorities in each session serve for both Aura and AlephBFT authorities, and on top of that are responsible for running the Aggregator protocol producing multisignatures of finalized blocks.

### Building

Please consult the [BUILD][build] guide.

### Running

#### Connect to Aleph Zero Testnet

You can connect to global Aleph Zero Testnet network by running `aleph-node --chain=testnet`.

#### Local Network

To experiment with Aleph Node you can locally run a small blockchain network using the [scripts/run_nodes.sh](scripts/run_nodes.sh) script from the root of this repository. Please consult the script or the output of `scripts/run_nodes.sh -help` for additional parameters (like the number of nodes etc.). The script starts multiple instances of Aleph Node on your local machine, so please adjust the number of nodes carefully with performance of your system in mind. By default 4 nodes are started.

You can interact with your locally running nodes using their RPC servers. A more convenient alternative is to attach to it with a polkadot.js wallet app. We recommend using our fork of that app which can be found [here][aleph-polkadot-link].
