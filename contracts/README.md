# TheButton

Series of smart contract based games, with varying tokenomics.
TheButton is based on the famous [game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Button_(Reddit)>) on reddit.

- Button lives for a set time.
- Pressing the button extends its life.
- Users are rewarded for playing the game.
- Everybody can play only once.

```
  |______|_______|
  |      |       |
start   now    deadline
```

## Red Button

There is a pre-minted amount of red tokens (a classic ERC20).
Users are rewarded for clicking as early on as possible, which should lead to them pushing the definite end of the game far into the future.

```
score = deadline - now
```

There are two built-in incentives:

- playing for score: If you clicked in the 10th second of TheButton's life set for example to 900 blocks you get rewarded based on score of 900-10=890 (and the button's life now will end at block 910).
- playing to be ThePressiah: the last player to click gets 50% of the total reward pool.

## Yellow button

Similar to Red Button, but in this scenario the rewards are reversed - players get rewarded for extending the button's life further into the future, i.e.:

```
score = now - start
```

## Blue button

Game continues in perpetuity (but in practice as long as there are accounts that can still play it)

- In each iteration of the game TheButton lives for a number of blocks
- Clicking TheButton resets its countdown timer (extending the button's life further into the future)
- Blue Tokens are continuously minted at the end of each iteration
- Players are rewarded for playing, with the ultimate goal of being the Pressiah (the last person to click the button)
- Reward rules:
  - If youâ€™re not ThePressiah, you get _k_ tokens if you pressed the button as the _k-th_ person in a row.
  - ThePressiah of the iteration with _k_ button presses gets [k*(k+1)]/2 tokens.

# Development

Firstly bootstrap a one-node chain based on our `smartnet` chain:

```bash
 ./.github/scripts/run_smartnet.sh
```

Secondly `deploy` script takes care of compiling, deploying and interacting with the contract(s):

```bash
./contracts/scripts/deploy.sh
```

Specifically it will:

- deploy the ERC20 token contract
- deploy the game contract
- transfer token balance to the game contract
- whitelist some accounts for playing the game
- interact with the game from the whitelisted account
- wait past the game deadline, trigger game end and reward distribution
- run an assert (simple check whether Pressiah received his reward according to the scheme). No more assertions are implemented at this point, as the hope is to soon start writing Rust-based tools for deployment and interacting with the contracts.
