# synthetic-network

This folder contains various scripts that allows to spawn and interact with `aleph-node` executed within a so called
synthetic-network. synthetic-network is a tool for docker that allows you to simulate different network conditions, like
variable latency, rate limit, etc. Easiest way to manage parameters of a synthetic-network is to use its web-ui - after
executing `run_consensus_synthetic-network.sh` it should be available at http://localhost:3000 (each node has separate settings
page, i.e. :3001 is Node1, ...).

# Content of this folder

Main file in this folder is `run_consensus_synthetic-network.sh`. It builds a docker-image containing `aleph-node` and some
arbitrary set of networking and debugging tools. It also consists of files required to spawn an instance of the
synthetic-network. Its requirements are: docker, docker-compose, git, `aleph-node:latest` docker-image.

`set_defaults_synthetic-network.sh` allows you to reset settings of the synthetic-network to some sane defaults. You might need
to use it when you set too restrictive values for some of its parameters, i.e. rate limit that make you unable to further
interact with its web-ui.

Additionally, this folder contains an example .js script introducing API of the synthetic-network. You can use it by executing
`run_script_for_synthetic-network.sh --script-path ./latency.js`.

# How to run e2e-tests that using synthetic-network?

```bash
# build aleph-node docker-image
# we assume that aleph-node binary is stored at ./target/release/aleph-node
aleph-node$ docker build -t aleph-node:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .

# build e2e-tests
aleph-node$ cd e2e-tests
e2e-tests$ cargo test --release --no-run --locked
# copy created binary to e2e-tests/target/release/, built test binary is in the last line of
# the above command, e.g.
# cp target/release/deps/aleph_e2e_client-44dc7cbed6112daa target/release/aleph-e2e-client
e2e-tests$ docker build --tag aleph-e2e-client:latest -f Dockerfile .
e2e-tests$ cd ..

# run synthetic-network with aleph-node using docker-compose
# by default, it should build for you a docker-image for synthetic-network
# consult its help for available options
./scripts/synthetic-network/run_consensus_synthetic-network.sh

# run tests for the block sync component
aleph-node$ VALIDATOR_COUNT=7 NETWORK="synthetic-network" NODE_URL="ws://Node0:9944" ./.github/scripts/run_e2e_test.sh -t test::sync -n 7
# another example
aleph-node$ .github/scripts/run_e2e_test.sh -t high_out_latency_for_all -a public.ecr.aws/p6e8q1z1/aleph-e2e-client:latest
```

There's a `OUT_LATENCY` env which control output latency in e2e tests. If not specified, there's 200ms
default used:
```shell
OUT_LATENCY=300 .github/scripts/run_e2e_test.sh -t high_out_latency_for_all -n 5 -a public.ecr.aws/p6e8q1z1/aleph-e2e-client:latest
```

If you'd like to start `run_consensus_synthetic-network.sh` again, run below command first. 
That will clear down docker storage, in particular it will clear previous latency setting.
```shell
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.synthetic-network.yml down
```
